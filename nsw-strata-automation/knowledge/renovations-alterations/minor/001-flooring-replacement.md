# Flooring Replacement in Private Lots

## Issue Description

Common flooring renovation inquiries:
- Replacing carpet with timber, laminate, or tile flooring
- Upgrading existing timber floors (sanding and polishing)
- Installing floating floors over existing flooring
- Acoustic underlay requirements
- Whether approval from owners corporation is required

Types of flooring changes:
- Carpet to timber/laminate (most common)
- Carpet to tiles
- Timber to tiles
- Refinishing existing timber floors

## NSW Legal Context

**Relevant Legislation:**

- **SSMA 2015, Section 108:** Approval required for minor renovations that may affect common property or another lot
- **SSMA 2015, Section 109:** Strata committee or general meeting can approve minor renovations
- **SSMA 2015, Section 110:** Process and requirements for renovation approval
- **Model By-law 7:** Owner must obtain written approval before carrying out renovations affecting common property or visible from outside lot

**Classification of Flooring Work:**

**Minor Renovation (requires strata approval):**
- Work does NOT affect structural support of building
- Work confined to interior of lot
- May affect acoustic performance between lots

**Major Renovation (requires detailed approval + development consent):**
- Structural changes to floor
- Affecting fire-rated floors
- Penetrations through common property slab

**Cosmetic Work (typically no approval required):**
- Replacing carpet with carpet
- Re-varnishing existing timber (no structural change)

**Most flooring replacements are Minor Renovations requiring strata approval.**
