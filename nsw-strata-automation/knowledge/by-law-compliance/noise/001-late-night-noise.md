# Late Night Noise Complaints

## Issue Description

What residents typically report:
- Loud music, television, or parties after 10 PM
- Persistent noise disturbance affecting sleep
- Heavy footfall or furniture dragging late at night
- Voices, shouting, or arguments audible through walls
- Regular pattern of noise violations (e.g., every weekend)

Common sources:
- Social gatherings and parties
- Home entertainment systems with inadequate sound insulation
- Hard flooring without adequate underlay (in apartments)
- Late-night activities (exercise, renovations, moving furniture)

## NSW Legal Context

**Relevant Legislation:**

- **SSMA 2015, Section 139:** Owners corporation may make by-laws prohibiting or regulating noise likely to interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of another resident
- **SSMA 2015, Section 147:** Penalty for not complying with by-laws (up to 5 penalty units = $550 as of 2025)
- **SSMA 2015, Section 153:** Orders by NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) to remedy or restrain breach
- **Model By-law 1 (Noise):** An owner or occupier of a lot must not create noise likely to interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of another

**Priority Level:** Medium (unless affecting health/safety, then High)

**Responsibility:**
- **Lot Owner/Occupier:** Comply with noise by-laws
- **Owners Corporation:** Enforce by-laws through appropriate channels
- **Strata Manager:** Facilitate resolution and record-keeping

**Quiet Hours (typical by-law):**
- Weekdays: 10 PM - 8 AM
- Weekends: 10 PM - 9 AM
- **Note:** Check specific strata scheme by-laws as these may vary

## Solution Steps

### 1. Initial Report and Documentation (Day 1)

**When complaint received:**
- Record date, time, and specific nature of noise
- Document complainant's contact details (kept confidential)
- Ask complainant to keep a noise diary:
  - Date and time of each occurrence
  - Duration of noise
  - Type and volume of noise
  - Impact on complainant (sleep loss, work disruption)

**Strata manager actions:**
- Thank complainant for reporting
- Explain the resolution process and expected timeline
- Provide copy of relevant noise by-laws
- Advise to also document via:
  - Audio/video recordings (if safe and reasonable)
  - Witness statements from other residents
  - NSW EPA noise monitoring app (if applicable)

### 2. Friendly Reminder (within 3-5 days)

**First contact approach:**
- Send **polite, educational letter** to alleged noise source
- Do NOT disclose complainant identity
- Letter should include:
  - General noise complaint received (no specific dates)
  - Copy of scheme's noise by-laws
  - Explanation of quiet hours
  - Request for cooperation in being considerate
  - Offer to discuss any questions

**Tone:** Educational and non-confrontational

**Example wording:**
> "Dear Resident, we have received reports of noise disturbance during quiet hours in your area of the building. We're writing to remind all residents of our noise by-law (attached) which requires consideration for neighbours, especially between 10 PM and 8 AM. If you have any questions about the by-laws or would like to discuss sound insulation options, please contact the strata manager. Thank you for your cooperation."

### 3. Formal Warning (if continues after 2 weeks)

**If noise continues with documented evidence:**
- Issue **formal breach notice** under SSMA 2015 Section 147
- Notice must specify:
  - Specific by-law being breached (e.g., By-law 1 - Noise)
  - Dates, times, and description of breaches (from diary/evidence)
  - Request to cease the breaches immediately
  - Potential penalties for ongoing non-compliance (up to $550 per breach)
  - Right to make representations to strata committee

**Delivery:**
- Send via registered mail or hand-delivered with acknowledgment
- Keep copy for strata records
- Set follow-up date (typically 14 days)

### 4. Mediation (if noise persists)

**Options for resolution:**

**Option A: Internal Mediation**
- Arrange meeting between parties (with strata manager as mediator)
- Discuss practical solutions:
  - Sound insulation improvements (rugs, underlay, acoustic panels)
  - Modified behavior (lower volume, time restrictions)
  - Building improvements (owners corporation expense if structural)

**Option B: Community Justice Centre Mediation**
- Free NSW government mediation service
- Independent trained mediators
- Voluntary but often effective
- Contact: 1800 990 777 or www.cjc.nsw.gov.au

### 5. NCAT Application (if unresolved)

**When to escalate:**
- Persistent breaches despite warnings
- Significant impact on complainant (health, wellbeing)
- Refusal to engage in mediation
- Evidence of systematic disregard for by-laws

**NCAT application process:**
- **Who can apply:** Owners corporation, individual owners, or occupiers
- **Application type:** Orders to enforce by-laws (SSMA 2015 Section 153)
- **Cost:** $50-$107 (depending on claim type)
- **Evidence required:**
  - Noise diary with specific dates/times
  - Audio/video recordings
  - Witness statements
  - Copies of warning letters sent
  - Strata scheme by-laws

**NCAT can order:**
- Cease the noise-making behavior
- Impose civil penalties
- Require sound insulation improvements
- Award compensation for loss or damage
- Legal costs in serious cases

**Timeline:** 8-16 weeks from application to hearing

## Prevention Advice

**For Owners Corporation:**
- Include noise by-laws information in new resident welcome packs
- Display noise guidelines in common areas
- Consider acoustic improvements during renovations:
  - Sound insulation requirements in by-laws for flooring
  - Acoustic ratings for windows and doors

**For Residents:**
- Install soft flooring with adequate underlay (especially important for hard floors)
- Use headphones for late-night entertainment
- Inform neighbors in advance of planned gatherings
- Position speakers away from shared walls
- Consider noise-dampening furniture pads

**Building Design Improvements:**
- Acoustic assessment of problematic areas
- Upgrade wall/floor insulation during capital works
- Address structural noise transmission issues

## Estimated Resolution Time

- **Friendly reminder stage:** Resolution in 30-40% of cases (2-3 weeks)
- **Formal warning stage:** Resolution in 40% of cases (4-6 weeks)
- **Mediation:** Resolution in 70% of cases that reach mediation (6-8 weeks)
- **NCAT application:** 8-16 weeks from application to resolution
- **Average overall resolution time:** 3 days (72 hours) for successful early intervention

**Success factors:**
- Quick initial response increases resolution rate
- Clear documentation supports enforcement
- Early mediation prevents escalation
