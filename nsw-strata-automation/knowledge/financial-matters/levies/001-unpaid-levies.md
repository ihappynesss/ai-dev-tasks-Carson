# Unpaid Strata Levies and Contributions

## Issue Description

Common scenarios involving unpaid levies:
- Owner falls behind on quarterly levy payments
- Financial hardship affecting ability to pay
- Dispute over levy amount or calculation
- New owner unaware of outstanding levies from previous owner
- Special levies for major works not paid
- Accumulated debt including interest and legal costs

Typical amounts:
- Regular quarterly levies: $500-$2,500 per quarter
- Special levies: $5,000-$50,000+ for major capital works
- Interest on arrears: Currently 10% per annum (as of 2025)

## NSW Legal Context

**Relevant Legislation:**

- **SSMA 2015, Section 85:** Owners corporation may recover unpaid contributions as a debt in a court of competent jurisdiction
- **SSMA 2015, Section 86:** Interest on unpaid contributions at rate determined by regulation (currently 10% p.a.)
- **SSMA 2015, Section 87:** Owners corporation has a charge over the lot for unpaid contributions
- **SSMA 2015, Section 88:** Charge ranks in priority ahead of most other interests (including mortgages for amounts up to certain limits)

**Priority Level:** High (unpaid levies affect owners corporation cash flow and ability to meet obligations)

**Key Legal Rights:**

1. **Automatic Statutory Charge:**
   - Owners corporation has automatic charge over lot for unpaid levies
   - Charge can be registered on title
   - Priority over most mortgages for up to 12 months arrears

2. **Interest:**
   - 10% per annum on unpaid amounts from due date
   - Compounds on unpaid amounts

3. **Recovery:**
   - Issue certificate of levy payments
   - Lodge caveat on title
   - Commence debt recovery proceedings
   - Seek orders for sale of lot (extreme cases)

## Solution Steps

### 1. Initial Contact (within 7 days of missed payment)

**First reminder (friendly):**
- Send payment reminder via email and post
- Confirm levy amount, due date, and payment methods
- Attach copy of invoice if not received
- Offer payment plan if financial hardship

**Content should include:**
- Amount overdue
- Payment methods available
- Contact for queries or payment arrangements
- Next steps if payment not received

### 2. Formal Levy Notice (30 days after due date)

**Issue formal notice under SSMA 2015:**
- Detail amount owing (including interest calculated)
- Payment deadline (typically 14 days)
- Consequences of non-payment:
  - Interest continuing to accrue at 10% p.a.
  - Legal costs may be added to debt
  - Potential caveat lodgement
  - Potential legal proceedings

**Delivery:**
- Send via registered post
- Email copy for faster receipt
- Keep proof of delivery for records

### 3. Payment Plan Negotiation (if requested)

**When owner requests payment plan:**

**Assess request:**
- Review owner's financial situation
- Consider impact on owners corporation cash flow
- Determine reasonable payment schedule

**Payment plan terms:**
- Documented written agreement required
- Typically 3-12 month repayment period
- May require upfront payment (e.g., 20-30%)
- Must include interest on outstanding balance
- Regular progress reviews (monthly)
- Default provisions if payments missed

**Committee approval:**
- Payment plans typically require committee or general meeting approval
- Document decision in meeting minutes

**Example payment plan:**
- Total owing: $5,000
- Upfront payment: $1,000
- Balance: $4,000 over 8 months = $500/month
- Continue paying current levies on time
- Interest continues on outstanding balance

### 4. Statutory Certificate and Caveat (60-90 days arrears)

**Issue Section 109 Certificate:**
- Owners corporation can issue certificate stating amount owing
- Certificate binds the lot with the debt
- Used in property sales or refinancing

**Lodge Caveat (if significant arrears):**
- Protects owners corporation interest
- Prevents sale or refinancing without paying debt
- Requires legal assistance to prepare
- Must be based on owners corporation's statutory charge

**When to use:**
- Arrears exceed $5,000-$10,000
- Owner not engaging with payment requests
- Risk of asset disposal without payment

### 5. Legal Proceedings (90+ days or significant arrears)

**Small Claims Court (arrears under $20,000):**
- Local Court jurisdiction
- Simplified procedures
- Lower legal costs
- Faster resolution (typically 2-4 months)

**District Court (arrears $20,000-$750,000):**
- More formal proceedings
- Higher legal costs
- Longer timeframe (typically 6-12 months)

**What owners corporation can claim:**
- Unpaid levies and contributions
- Interest at 10% p.a.
- Legal costs (typically on indemnity basis)
- Court filing fees

**Orders available:**
- Judgment for debt
- Payment orders (lump sum or installments)
- Order for sale of lot (rare, extreme cases only)

### 6. Enforcement (if judgment obtained but not paid)

**Enforcement options:**
- Writ of execution (seize and sell personal property)
- Garnishee order (intercept wages or bank accounts)
- Examination notice (require owner to disclose assets)
- Bankruptcy proceedings (if debt exceeds $10,000)
- Order for sale of lot (last resort)

## Prevention Advice

**For Owners Corporations:**
- Send levy notices well in advance (30+ days before due date)
- Offer multiple payment methods (direct debit, BPAY, credit card)
- Communicate levy increases clearly in advance
- Provide annual budget breakdown to all owners
- Act quickly on arrears (don't let debts accumulate)

**For Owners:**
- Set up automatic direct debit for quarterly levies
- Budget for special levies when announced
- Contact strata manager immediately if payment difficulties
- Understand levy calculations and what they fund
- Keep payment records and receipts

**Best Practices:**
- Send levy notices 30 days before due date
- Follow up within 7 days of missed payment
- Offer payment plans early (before legal costs escalate)
- Document all communications
- Seek legal advice when arrears exceed $10,000

## Estimated Resolution Time

- **Payment plan negotiation:** 2-4 weeks
- **Caveat lodgement:** 1-2 weeks (plus legal prep time)
- **Small claims court:** 2-4 months from filing to judgment
- **District Court:** 6-12 months
- **Enforcement after judgment:** Varies (2 weeks to 6+ months)

**Average overall resolution:** 5 days (120 hours) for payment plans; 6-9 months for court proceedings

**Factors affecting timeline:**
- Owner cooperation and financial situation
- Amount of arrears
- Court availability and backlog
- Complexity of enforcement
