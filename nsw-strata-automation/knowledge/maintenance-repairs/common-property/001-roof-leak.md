# Roof Leak in Common Property

## Issue Description

What property owners and tenants typically report:
- Water leaking through ceiling in top-floor units
- Visible water stains on walls or ceilings
- Damp patches appearing during or after rainfall
- Mould developing in affected areas
- Dripping sounds from ceiling cavity

Common causes:
- Degraded roof membrane or tiles
- Blocked gutters causing overflow
- Damaged flashing around roof penetrations
- Severe weather damage (storms, hail)

## NSW Legal Context

**Relevant Legislation:**

- **SSMA 2015, Section 106:** Owners corporation has a duty to maintain and repair common property, including roofs, in good and serviceable repair
- **SSDA 2015, Section 132:** Defect liability periods and building warranties for structural defects (up to 6 years)
- **Model By-law 3:** Lot owners must not damage common property

**Priority Level:** Critical (emergency repairs required when affecting safety or habitability)

**Responsibility:**
- **Owners Corporation:** Responsible for roof maintenance and repairs (common property)
- **Individual Lot Owner:** Only responsible if damage was caused by their alterations or negligence

**2025 NSW Reforms:**
- Capital works fund planning must include roof maintenance in mandatory 10-year plan
- Enhanced disclosure requirements for known roof defects before property sales
- Stricter building warranty requirements for new developments

## Solution Steps

### 1. Immediate Response (within 24 hours)

**Actions:**
- Contact owners corporation emergency maintenance provider immediately
- Arrange temporary waterproofing (tarps, emergency patches) if weather threatens
- Place buckets/containers to catch water and protect belongings
- Document damage with dated photographs from multiple angles
- Record weather conditions at time of leak

**Contact Numbers:**
- Emergency building services: [Insert contact]
- Strata manager after-hours: [Insert contact]

### 2. Initial Assessment (within 3-5 business days)

**Requirements:**
- Engage licensed building inspector or roof specialist
- Conduct thorough roof inspection (visual and potentially invasive)
- Determine extent and cause of damage
- Identify if issue is:
  - General wear and tear (OC responsibility)
  - Building defect (potential builder liability if within warranty)
  - Lot owner damage (lot owner responsibility)

**Deliverable:** Written inspection report with photos, cause analysis, and recommended repairs

### 3. Repair Planning (within 1-2 weeks)

**Process:**
- Obtain minimum 3 competitive quotes from licensed waterproofing contractors
- Ensure contractors have:
  - Current NSW building license
  - Public liability insurance ($20M minimum)
  - Workers compensation insurance
  - Relevant experience with strata properties

**Approval Requirements:**
- Under $10,000: Building manager or strata manager may approve
- $10,000-$30,000: Committee approval typically required
- Over $30,000: May require general meeting approval (check by-laws)

### 4. Repair Execution (timeframe varies)

**Timeline:**
- Emergency temporary repairs: Same day or next business day
- Minor repairs: 1-2 weeks
- Major roof replacement: 4-12 weeks (weather dependent)

**During repairs:**
- Notify affected residents of work schedule
- Arrange access to rooftop and affected lots for inspection
- Maintain clear communication on progress
- Take progress photos for records

### 5. Post-Repair Follow-up

**Completion tasks:**
- Final inspection to confirm repairs are satisfactory
- Obtain completion certificate from licensed contractor
- Update building maintenance records
- Check affected lots for secondary damage (mould, structural)
- Consider insurance claim if applicable (within 6 months)
- Update capital works fund schedule if needed

## Prevention Advice

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Schedule annual pre-winter roof inspections (March-April)
- Clean gutters and downpipes quarterly
- Trim overhanging tree branches
- Inspect after severe weather events

**Capital Works Planning:**
- Include roof membrane replacement in 10-year capital works plan
- Budget for roof replacement every 15-25 years (depending on material)
- Maintain reserve fund for emergency repairs

**Early Detection:**
- Encourage residents to report water stains immediately
- Install moisture sensors in high-risk areas
- Monitor attic spaces for early signs of water ingress

## Estimated Resolution Time

- **Emergency temporary waterproofing:** Same day (1-4 hours)
- **Full minor repair:** 2-4 weeks
- **Major roof section replacement:** 6-12 weeks
- **Full roof replacement:** 12-20 weeks
- **Insurance claim processing:** Additional 4-8 weeks

**Factors affecting timeline:**
- Weather conditions (cannot do roof work in rain)
- Contractor availability
- Building defect investigations (if applicable)
- Committee or general meeting approval processes
