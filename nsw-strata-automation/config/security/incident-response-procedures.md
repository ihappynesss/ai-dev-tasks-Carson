---

## Phase 1: Detection & Initial Response

### Detection Methods

1. **Automated Monitoring**
   - Prometheus alerts (error rates, unusual traffic)
   - Supabase row-level security violations
   - Failed authentication attempts (>5 in 15 minutes)
   - Unusual API usage patterns
   - System resource anomalies

2. **Manual Detection**
   - User reports of suspicious activity
   - Audit log reviews
   - Security tool scans
   - Third-party notifications

### Immediate Actions (Within 15 minutes)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency response script

# 1. Isolate affected systems
docker-compose stop n8n  # Stop affected service

# 2. Preserve evidence
docker-compose logs n8n > /var/log/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres n8n > /var/backups/incident-db-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# 3. Alert team
curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT DETECTED - Level P0"}'

# 4. Enable incident mode
echo "INCIDENT_MODE=true" >> .env
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.incident.yml up -d
```

---

## Phase 2: Investigation & Containment

### Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Identify affected systems and data
- [ ] Determine attack vector and timeline
- [ ] Assess scope of compromise
- [ ] Identify attackers (IPs, user accounts)
- [ ] Review audit logs and access logs
- [ ] Check for persistence mechanisms
- [ ] Document all findings

### Evidence Collection

```bash
# System logs
docker-compose logs --since 24h > logs/docker-$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Database audit logs
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d n8n -c "
  SELECT * FROM knowledge_base_audit
  WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
" > evidence/db-audit-$(date +%Y%m%d).csv

# Authentication logs
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d n8n -c "
  SELECT * FROM auth_audit_log
  WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND (success = false OR event_type = 'failed_login')
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
" > evidence/auth-audit-$(date +%Y%m%d).csv

# Network traffic logs
tcpdump -i eth0 -w evidence/network-$(date +%Y%m%d).pcap
```

### Containment Actions

**Level P0/P1**
1. Isolate affected systems from network
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Block attacker IP addresses
4. Disable affected user accounts
5. Reset all API keys
6. Enable enhanced logging

**Level P2/P3**
1. Monitor suspicious activity
2. Apply security patches
3. Update firewall rules
4. Increase logging verbosity

---

## Phase 3: Eradication & Recovery

### Eradication Steps

```bash
# 1. Remove malware/backdoors
find /var/www -name "*.php" -mtime -1 -ls  # Recent suspicious files
docker system prune -af  # Clean all containers and images

# 2. Patch vulnerabilities
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
npm audit fix --force

# 3. Reset credentials
./scripts/rotate-all-credentials.sh

# 4. Rebuild from clean backups
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up -d --build

# 5. Restore data from pre-incident backup
pg_restore -h localhost -U postgres -d n8n /var/backups/clean-backup.sql
```

### Recovery Verification

- [ ] All systems operational
- [ ] No unauthorized access detected
- [ ] All vulnerabilities patched
- [ ] Monitoring systems operational
- [ ] Backups verified
- [ ] Security controls tested

## Phase 4: Post-Incident Analysis

### Incident Report Template

```markdown
# Security Incident Report

**Incident ID**: INC-2025-001
**Severity**: P1 - High
**Date Detected**: 2025-10-15 14:30 UTC
**Date Resolved**: 2025-10-15 18:45 UTC

## Executive Summary
Brief description of incident, impact, and resolution.

## Timeline
- 14:30 UTC: Unusual API activity detected by Prometheus
- 14:35 UTC: Investigation initiated
- 14:45 UTC: Unauthorized access confirmed
- 15:00 UTC: Affected systems isolated
- 15:30 UTC: Credentials rotated
- 16:00 UTC: Vulnerability patched
- 17:00 UTC: Systems restored
- 18:45 UTC: Incident closed

## Technical Details
- Attack vector: SQL injection in custom webhook handler
- Affected systems: n8n workflow engine, PostgreSQL database
- Data accessed: 150 ticket records (non-PII)
- Attacker IP: 203.0.113.42
- Persistence: None detected

## Impact Assessment
- **Users affected**: 0 (no PII exposed)
- **Downtime**: 2 hours 15 minutes
- **Data loss**: None
- **Financial impact**: $0
- **Reputational impact**: Low (contained before public awareness)

## Root Cause
Insufficient input validation in custom webhook handler (webhook-signature-verification.js:142) allowed SQL injection attack.

## Remediation Actions Taken
1. Patched SQL injection vulnerability
2. Added input sanitization
3. Rotated all database credentials
4. Blocked attacker IP
5. Enhanced monitoring for similar attacks

## Lessons Learned
- Input validation must be applied consistently across all endpoints
- Automated security testing should cover custom code
- Faster detection possible with stricter SQL query monitoring

## Recommendations
1. Implement automated code security scanning (Snyk, SonarQube)
2. Add rate limiting to all webhook endpoints
3. Enable database query logging for anomaly detection
4. Conduct security training for development team
5. Schedule quarterly penetration testing
