### Notes

- n8n workflows are stored as JSON files and can be imported/exported through the n8n UI
- Credentials in n8n are encrypted and managed through the platform's credential system
- Database migrations should be versioned and run sequentially
- Knowledge base entries follow the template structure defined in the PRD
- Monitoring configurations integrate with n8n's built-in metrics
